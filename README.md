# GlookoProblem
This is the results of my data challenge for the position of Data Analyst.  

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

- The file: GotThis.py is the python code to extract the data from Twitter and put it into a .txt file.  I converted those files to .csv which are found on the git page.
- The file: GlookoData.py is the python code that does all the analysis.

## Data

The data includes each companies with the following features: 

**Features**
1) Company Name
2) Date of Tweet 
3) Number of Retweets
4) Number of Favorites
5) Number of Followers

### Notes:
NOTE: you might think it is easier to using Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python - its not and it was a huge waste of my time
